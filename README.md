## Editing .csv file in Excel
### Used Python in Jupyter notebook to find the null values. Came up with 20-30 nulls in the city, state, and zipcode columns. Filtered for the nulls in Excel. Filled all null values in the state column with IN.  Then manually Googled the address to find the missing pieces. Estimated city and zipcode for 2 addresses that were at interstate exits and not actual businesses or homes.
